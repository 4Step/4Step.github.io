As we can see, name "Windows7" itself is boring, clearly showing lack of passion towards the product. Can't they name something like "remake of awful OS Vista".

Finally got around to putting this website together. Lets see how it well it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is much more fun than my previous webpages developed with pure html or Adobe Flash back in the day (early 2000's).
